Installation
------------

You'll need following prerequisites first:

* [Mongrel2](http://mongrel2.org/downloads)

Next, in your `Gemfile` add:

```ruby
gem 'm2r'
```

And finally run:

```
bundle install
```

Guides
------

### Running Rack Application

#### Gemfile

Add `m2r` to `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`

#### Mongrel 2

[Configure `Handler`](http://mongrel2.org/static/book-finalch4.html#x6-260003.4) for your application:

```
rack_example = Handler(
  send_spec  = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9997",
  send_ident = "14fff75f-3474-4089-af6d-bbd67735ab89",
  recv_spec  = "tcp://127.0.0.1:9996",
  recv_ident = ""
)
```

#### Start

```bash
[bundle exec] rackup -s mongrel2 application.ru
```

Add `-O option_name` to provide options for m2r handler:

```ruby
[bundle exec] rackup -s mongrel2 another.ru -O recv_addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:9995 -O send_addr=tcp://127.0.0.1:9994
```

#### Options

* `recv_addr` - This is the `send_spec` option from `Handler` configuration in `mongrel2.conf`. Default: `tcp://127.0.0.1:9997`
* `send_addr` - This is the `recv_sped` option from `Handler` configuration in your `mongrel2.conf`. Default: `tcp://127.0.0.1:9996`

### Developing custom bare Handler

TBD

Usage/Examples
-----
